Support relation column paths of arbitrary depth (`relation.field`, `a.b.c`, e.g. `base.name` or `author.manager.name`) in both `where` column filters and `sort`.

- **MikroORM `where` (fix):** a dotted relation path in a column filter used to emit a flat `{ 'base.name': … }` key, which the QueryBuilder rendered as a raw `base.name` column against an alias that was never joined — producing a **500 "Unknown column 'base.name'"**. The resolver now expands dotted paths into nested objects (`{ base: { name: … } }`, nested for each hop) so MikroORM auto-joins the relation(s). Operator/logical keys (`$and`, `$or`, `$not`, `$like`, …) are preserved.
- **Sort (fix):** `validateSorts` silently dropped any `relation.field` sort because it only checked scalar columns, so ordering by a relation column (e.g. `base.name`) was a no-op. It now accepts any path that resolves to a scalar column through one or more relations. A bare relation (`author`) is rejected for sorting (you can't order by a relation object), as are unknown relations, unknown leaves, and segments traversed through a scalar.
- **MikroORM `applySort`:** emits a nested `orderBy` (`{ author: { manager: { name: 'desc' } } }`) for relation paths so each relation is auto-joined for ordering.
- **New adapter capability `resolveFieldPath(entity, path)`** (optional on `FilterAdapter`): classifies a path as `'field'` (scalar leaf, possibly through relations), `'relation'` (bare relation reference), or `null` (invalid). The runner delegates both sort validation and `where` pruning to it, so a bad deep path is dropped before reaching the ORM instead of crashing. Implemented for MikroORM; adapters that don't implement it keep the previous single-hop behavior.

TypeORM behavior is unchanged: its adapter still scopes relation sort/where to single-segment safe field names, so relation paths remain gracefully ignored (no crash) there.
