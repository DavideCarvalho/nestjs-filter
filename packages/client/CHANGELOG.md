## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`a023326`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/a023326cc18316dfe0c2cb8bf9d4bb3a4ec72c80) - Make the query builder a framework-agnostic reactive store. `FilterQueryBuilder`
  (and `filterQueryTyped`) now implement `subscribe(listener)`, `getSnapshot()`, and
  `getVersion()`: every mutation bumps a version, invalidates a cached snapshot, and
  notifies subscribers. `getSnapshot()` returns a stable reference until the next
  mutation — exactly what `useSyncExternalStore` (React), `customRef`/`shallowRef` (Vue),
  and the Svelte store contract need to drive the builder as reactive state.

  Fully backward compatible: the store methods are additive and the builder stays a
  mutable fluent builder. `or()`/`and()` sub-builders remain isolated — their internal
  mutations never notify the parent's subscribers.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`d7ecd90`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/d7ecd9019495aaafdbc1737a1cec20b0f75f91bc) - Type-aware filter operators. The typed client builder (`filterQueryTyped<Fields, Map>`)
  now narrows operators and value types per field: string fields accept only string
  operators, number/Date accept ordering + tuple, enums narrow to their literals, and
  the unary convenience methods (`isEmpty`/`isNotEmpty`) are gated to fields whose type
  allows them. Backward compatible — the single-generic builder stays fully permissive.

  Adds an optional `@FilterFor('key', { type })` hint (stored in separate metadata, no
  runtime effect) so virtual filter fields with no matching entity column can still get
  precise types in the generated client. Also hardens the type-vs-runtime operator
  drift guard to assert per-group from a single source of truth.

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- [`d72a84d`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/d72a84d72fb42da8ec567f87ba171ed040f2e9a5) - Fix: add "default" export condition for CJS compatibility (Node 26 strict exports resolution).

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [`9e1c8f5`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/9e1c8f5423a67249f7626dcb03cfe8477770cdf5) - Add TypedFilterQuery<Fields> type and filterQueryTyped<Fields>() builder for type-safe integration with nestjs-inertia codegen.

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- [`6b22e31`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/6b22e3153f1f0b275bd579f6fade8facae61b8a7) - Initial release of nestjs-filter.

  Structured input format with three top-level keys: filter, include, search.

  Core features:

  - Declarative filter classes with @FilterFor, @Filterable, @ApplyFilter
  - Auto-fields with entity metadata introspection
  - 22 built-in operators with AND/OR composition
  - Dot-notation relation filtering (posts.title)
  - Eager loading via ?include=role,posts
  - Global search via ?search=term (ILIKE or tsvector)
  - applyDynamic() for querying any entity without a filter class
  - AsyncLocalStorage state isolation
  - class-validator integration
  - FilterTestingModule + makeMockQueryBuilder

  Adapters: MikroORM 7, TypeORM 0.3+
  Client: Zero-dependency fluent query builder

### Minor Changes

- [`0cd738a`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/0cd738a41105812bad6bee876d4c707bf815258f) - Initial release. Declarative ORM-agnostic filter classes for NestJS.

  Core: BaseFilter, FilterRunner, @Filterable, @FilterFor, @ApplyFilter decorators, FilterModule, auto-fields with entity metadata introspection, dot-notation relation filtering, 22 built-in operators with AND/OR composition, bracket notation query string support, class-validator integration, FilterExceptionFilter, FilterTestingModule, makeMockQueryBuilder.

  Adapters: MikroORM 7 and TypeORM with full operator support, entity metadata introspection, and relation filtering.

  Client: Zero-dependency fluent query builder for browser and Node.js with type-safe operator validation.
