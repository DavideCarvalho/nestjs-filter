# @dudousxd/nestjs-filter

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`d7ecd90`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/d7ecd9019495aaafdbc1737a1cec20b0f75f91bc) - Type-aware filter operators. The typed client builder (`filterQueryTyped<Fields, Map>`)
  now narrows operators and value types per field: string fields accept only string
  operators, number/Date accept ordering + tuple, enums narrow to their literals, and
  the unary convenience methods (`isEmpty`/`isNotEmpty`) are gated to fields whose type
  allows them. Backward compatible — the single-generic builder stays fully permissive.

  Adds an optional `@FilterFor('key', { type })` hint (stored in separate metadata, no
  runtime effect) so virtual filter fields with no matching entity column can still get
  precise types in the generated client. Also hardens the type-vs-runtime operator
  drift guard to assert per-group from a single source of truth.

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- [`d72a84d`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/d72a84d72fb42da8ec567f87ba171ed040f2e9a5) - Fix: add "default" export condition for CJS compatibility (Node 26 strict exports resolution).

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- [`dad7e77`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/dad7e776fe85f2477deb4a11b320633207d56901) - Export OffsetPagination, CursorPagination, SortItem types and add sort + paginate to StructuredInput.

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- [`6b22e31`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/6b22e3153f1f0b275bd579f6fade8facae61b8a7) - Initial release of nestjs-filter.

  Structured input format with three top-level keys: filter, include, search.

  Core features:

  - Declarative filter classes with @FilterFor, @Filterable, @ApplyFilter
  - Auto-fields with entity metadata introspection
  - 22 built-in operators with AND/OR composition
  - Dot-notation relation filtering (posts.title)
  - Eager loading via ?include=role,posts
  - Global search via ?search=term (ILIKE or tsvector)
  - applyDynamic() for querying any entity without a filter class
  - AsyncLocalStorage state isolation
  - class-validator integration
  - FilterTestingModule + makeMockQueryBuilder

  Adapters: MikroORM 7, TypeORM 0.3+
  Client: Zero-dependency fluent query builder
