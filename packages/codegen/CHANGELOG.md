## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#51](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/pull/51) [`3f21e1f`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/3f21e1f9d40ca7f210518f6ab2c8e52c3ecd2dd8) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Native to-many aggregate fields: sort and filter root rows by an aggregate of a one-to-many / many-to-many collection via a virtual sub-path — `posts.$count`, `posts.$sum.views`, `posts.$avg.rating`, `posts.$min.createdAt`, `posts.$max.total`.

  - `sort=-posts.$count`, `posts.$sum.views[gt]=100`, and the typed `filterQuery().sortDesc('posts.$count').where('posts.$sum.views','gt',100)` all work.
  - Compiled to correlated scalar subqueries (both adapters; TypeORM param-free) — no row multiplication, pagination stays intact. Many-to-many correlates through the pivot/junction table.
  - Auto-discovered from ORM metadata under `autoFields: true` (with no `allowed` list), subject to the block-list; only real numeric child columns qualify for `$sum`/`$avg`/`$min`/`$max`; the client comparison value is always bound as a parameter.
  - Empty collection: `$count` → 0, `$sum` → 0 (COALESCE), `$avg`/`$min`/`$max` → NULL.
  - Typed as `number` in the generated `filterQuery()`, pruned by `maxDepth` (an aggregate path counts as one relation hop).

  Computed string sources are now emitted verbatim in both the MikroORM and TypeORM adapters — the `{alias}` token is no longer substituted. A correlated subquery in a _computed_ field must use the function form (`({ alias }) => ...`). Computed fields are for virtual columns that don't exist in a table (e.g. `fullName`); to aggregate a to-many collection, use the native aggregate paths above.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#47](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/pull/47) [`d2a2a71`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/d2a2a71f5aa08959b4683ee3bfddb9a06065012a) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Fix computed fields (`@Computed` methods / inline `computed` map) not being surfaced in `filterFields`/`filterFieldTypes` when running under `@dudousxd/nestjs-codegen` >= 0.3.

  The extension resolved a route's filter class through `ctx.project()`, which recent `nestjs-codegen` returns as an empty, tsconfig-less ts-morph `Project`. The controller source was never found, so the augmentation silently no-op'd (entity columns still rendered because those come pre-expanded from the discovery pass). The extension now seeds its own `Project` from the app's `tsconfig.json` — so `paths` aliases like `@/api/...` resolve — and adds the controller file on demand, falling back to `ctx.project()` when no tsconfig is loadable. Adds an on-disk regression test exercising a `paths`-aliased filter import.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#45](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/pull/45) [`99c7010`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/99c70105fc667085e59a81b8441cdcc990b8a275) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Computed fields now accept three source forms — a SQL string, a function
  (`(ctx) => string | raw`), or an ORM query-builder callback — via the inline
  `computed` map or the new `@Computed` method decorator. Both attachment styles
  are surfaced as typed fields by the codegen (`@Computed`/`{ source, type }`
  carry value types; bare map entries type the field name). Adapter hook
  signatures `applyComputedField`/`applyComputedSort` now receive the raw
  `ComputedSource` (internal change; only bundled adapters implement them).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#41](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/pull/41) [`1c6bd97`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/1c6bd9751108030a752fd3917ae7ec356ca63633) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - `nestjsFilterCodegen({ maxDepth })` caps relation-path recursion depth in the generated `filterFields` union, guarding against the union blowing up on `autoFields: true` entities with deep/wide relation graphs. Overridable per filter via `@Filterable({ codegen: { maxDepth } })`, which takes precedence over the global option. Default stays uncapped (unchanged behavior).

  `@Filterable` now accepts an optional `codegen: { maxDepth }` field on `FilterableOptions`/`FilterMetadata` — metadata only, read statically by `@dudousxd/nestjs-filter-codegen`; the core runtime ignores it.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [`876c7e0`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-filter/commit/876c7e095b3f9efe4e52c154f903d5fa9284f828) - Emit runtime filter metadata on each filterable route's api member:
  `filter: { fields: [...], types: { field: kind } }`. Reuses the field list and
  classified kinds the extension already discovers, so clients can default their
  allowlist (and type-aware operator resolution) from the route instead of
  hand-maintaining `FILTERABLE_FIELDS`. Backward compatible — the typed
  `filterQuery()` member is unchanged.
